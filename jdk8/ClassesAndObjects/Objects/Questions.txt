1. 
Syntax error:
Rectangle myRect;
- miss "new" keyword
- miss "Initialization" of Rectangle

myRect.width = 40;
myRect.height = 50;

myRect.area();


Fix: 
Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle();
myRect.setWidth(40);
myRect.setHeight(50);
myRect.area(width, height);

3.  A program does not explicitly destroy objects. 
    A program can set all references to an object to null so that it becomes eligible for garbage collection. 
    But the program does not actually destroy objects.
